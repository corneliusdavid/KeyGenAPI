# KeyGenAPI
Delphi component to access the [KeyGen](https://keygen.sh/) API. Written in Delphi 11 but could be back-ported several versions--as long as JSON and REST client components are supported.

This is just a start that calls one of the API endpoint, ValidateKey. It's all I need at the moment and may add to this later.
